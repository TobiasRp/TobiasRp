### Hi there, I'm Tobias

Currently, I am a software engineer at Bosch where I develop embedded computer vision solutions for driving assistance systems. Sadly, you won't find this here.

My projects often involve Python, C++/CUDA, or a mix of both. I've also dabbled a bit with Rust. Have fun checking out my projects!
