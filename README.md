### Hi there, I'm Tobias

I love working with data: From exploratory analysis and visualization, to machine learning, to extracting value and insights.

I believe that it is our responsibility as computer scientists and engineers to avoid slow and inefficient software. Then again, maybe I just love writing optimized, distributed, and parallel software...

My projects often involve Python, C++/CUDA, or a mix of both. Have fun checking out my projects!
